## CHALLENGE: Bridging the Gap

Although in quantum chemistry we are always concerned with obtaining the ground state, this is not the only relevant information we can get from a molecule. Another important feature to calculate is what is known as the spectral gap. The spectral gap of a system is the energy difference between its ground state and its first excited state. There are many situations in which knowing this value is very important and your objective will be to design and implement a method that is able to obtain this quantity.

As always, you are free to choose your method. You can opt for techniques that use short circuits and approximate the value, or techniques designed for fault-tolerant computers that achieve high accuracy. We will value both the idea and the implementation.

# Project abstract

This work introduces a novel **NISQ-friendly** procedure for estimating spectral gaps in quantum systems. By leveraging **Adiabatic Thermalization**, we are able to create the Spectral Gap Superposition state, a newly defined quantum state exhibiting observable fluctuations in time that allow for the accurate estimation of **any energy gap**. Our method is tested by estimating the energy gap between the ground and the first excited state for: the **Ising** model, the **Hydrogen** molecule (H2) and **Helium** molecule (He2). Despite limiting our circuit design to have at most **40 Trotter steps**, our numerical experiments of both noiseless and noisy devices for the presented systems give relative errors in the order of $10^{−2}$ and $10^{−1}$. Further experiments on the **IonQ Aria device (with error mitigation)** lead to spectral gap estimations with a relative error of **$10^{−2}$** for a 4-site Ising chain, demonstrating the validity of the procedure for NISQ devices and charting a path towards a new way of calculating energy gaps.
